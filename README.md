## Corkboard Studio - Bootcamp #2: Maze Game

This repository contains the complete GameMaker project for a simple maze game, created as the second project in the Corkboard Studio developer bootcamp.

The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of grid-based movement, simple enemy AI, and managing game states across multiple levels. This project was built by following the "Maze Game" tutorial series by Mr. Ridgway on YouTube.

This is another step on the public journey of learning the skills necessary to develop my flagship project, *Of Mice and Tales*.

#### Key Skills Practiced:

* Player movement (cardinal directions)
* Grid-based collision using `place_meeting()`
* Simple enemy AI and pathing
* Score and state persistence between levels
* Camera and view management

#### Attribution:

This project was made possible by the excellent and easy-to-follow tutorial series from **Mr. Ridgway on YouTube**. You can find the start of the series here:
